is with a weapon more powerful
than any atomic device.

I'm sorry.

820
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:10.520
How about her? Is she gone, too?

821
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.230
Her, too.

822
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.230
Not nearly as sorry about that.

823

Ah.

833
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.440
Now, you know everything.

834
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.440
My origin story.

835
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.990
I was sitting in this
exact spot almost...

836
00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:11.080
a hundred years ago.

837
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.910
This was a silent movie house
before they built it back up.

838
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.170
My mama played the piano
right over there.

839
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.750
It burnt, too.

840
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.840
Last thing I saw
before my world ended

841
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:31.180
was Bass Reeves,
the Black Marshal of Oklahoma.

842
00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:35.390
Fifteen feet tall in flickering
black and white.

843
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.850
<i>"Trust in the law," he said.</i>

844
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.400
And I did.

845
00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.530
So, I took his name
after Tulsa burned.

846
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.150
He was my hero.

847
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.620
That's why I became a cop.

848
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:53.370
Then, I realized,

849
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.910
there was a reason
Bass Reeves hid his face.

850
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.170
<i>So, I hid mine, too.</i>

851
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.420
Hooded Justice.

852
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:07.420
<font color="#138ce9">WILL:</font> Mm. The hood.

853
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:10.010
When I put it on,

854
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.050
you felt what I felt?

855
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.220
Anger.

856
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.520
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

857
00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.190
But it wasn't.

858
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.240
It was fear... and hurt.

859
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.910
You can't heal
under a mask, Angela.

860
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.920
Wounds need air.

861
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.460
He wanted me to give him up.

862
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.920
He told me you'd
try to save him,

863
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.720
but this was the way
it had to be.

864
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:54.180
You can't make an omelet without
breaking a couple of eggs.

865
00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.770
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

866
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:01.940
That's just something he said,

867
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.400
when we met way back then.

868
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.900
He said you would understand
when the time was right.
